Lin Yueru:I didn't mean to...It's all your fault in thefirst place! I just...
Li Xiaoyao:She must be kidding, how amI to dodge a sudden stab...
Zhao Ling'er:Ah! Xiaoyao, don't die!

trap up ahead. Please be
careful not to step on it.
I'll surely trap the antler.Doctor Han:Ms. Zhao... sorry for being
blunt, they're concerned
but why do you avoid them?
Zhao Ling'er:I... don't want to let them
know about this matter.
Doctor Han:I see... Don't worry,I'll keep it as a secret.
Doctor Han:*Sigh* but... as an unwed...and with your health,
how do you live if there's
no one to care for you?
Zhao Ling'er:Doctor...Doctor Han:You can stay here for awhile and think about it.Doctor Han:There's no doubt I can tellMr. Li～isn't a fickle man.

be able to fight them.Villager:Man, I should've farmed riceinstead, to reap a fortune.
Villager:This is so ridiculous! The
merchants are selling rice
for such a high price.
Villager:Man, curse these sellers

Check it's not sticky rice!
Villager:Hey man! You better line upor I'll beat you.Villager:Hey friend, can you savethe spot for me?I need to go to toilet.Villager:Stop quarreling.

to pry my business? Begone!
Li Xiaoyao:It's not about who's prying,
no one's gonna tolerate this.
Rice Seller:They're not savvy enough
when Black Water Village
was attacked, with no one
taking it seriously. I've
seized the chance and bought
all the rice to turn around
with ten times profit～Haha!
Rice Seller:Got to be smart in business,
learn to seek opportunities.We are selling weapons too.Buy for some protection? Or

village. I knew that you
aren't an ordinary person.
Villager:You know I can do it too, Ijust let you take the glory.Villager:We appreciate your help, but

Villager:Savior, let's carve a statue.
So we can idolize you daily!Zhi Ze:Ah... Sir... Yes..
... Came for prayers?
Li Xiaoyao:We came for Master Zhi Xiu.Zhi Ze:M... Master～we've guests!
Zhi Ze:Please, wait here... I'll...I'll inform my master.
Lin Yueru:What's wrong with this monk,
so queasy upon seeing us?
Li Xiaoyao:Ha～ how could even a monk
remain calmed after seeing
you 2 beauties?
Lin Yueru:   Pff～be serious!
Zhao Ling'er:.......Li Xiaoyao:   Ling'er... what's wrong?
Zhao Ling'er:I kept sensing in this temple
that... there's a spirit.
Li Xiaoyao:Really? How could it be!
This is a divine temple.
Zhao Ling'er:I'm unable to say... but
it's not really sinister.
Zhi Ze:I'm really sorry... we can'tattend to any visitors now.Li Xiaoyao:Oh, is Master Zhi Xiu away?Zhi Ze:Well, it's messy inside, wehave to clean up so...
Lin Yueru:Nonsense! Call your Master
or are you hiding something?Zhi Ze:Y... Yes!
Monk:Amitabha.....Monk:Amitabha.....Lin Yueru:What's wrong with the monks?All they say is Amitabha.Zhi Ze:Wahhh～!~30Li Xiaoyao:Hey～master! Calm down!
Zhi Zhang:I've had enough! I'm gonna
chop down this bastard.
Li Xiaoyao:May I know what's going on?Zhi Zhang:This bastard deceived me!
I was working as a butcher before, and have to eat at
least 3kg of meat daily.
He said that if I become a
monk, then I can eat much
more without working. It was
all lies upon coming here!
Zhi Ze:There's food and drinks, no?Zhi Zhang:EAT RICE, DRINK TEA right!?
Li Xiaoyao:Think you've mistaken...A monk has to be vegetarian.Zhi Zhang:Can I quit being a monk?
I finally caught a wild deerand I was about to eat itand who the hell everthought he pour it all away.
Li Xiaoyao:A wild deer...?Zhi Zhang:Yes～a deer with a broken
horn and injured leg. Seeing
it's rotten to the bone, I
relieved its suffering early!
Li Xiaoyao:You...(
Lin Yueru:Just go if you want to quit.Such behavior is unsightly.
Zhi Zhang:I wish I could go!
Lin Yueru:What do you mean?Zhi Zhang:The day when Master Zhi Xiushaved my hair, I lost allmy memory except for being abutcher and my meat cravings!
Lin Yueru:Funny to have such weird man!
Zhi Ze:Everyone, here is my master,Master Zhi Xiu.Zhi Zhang:I want to eat meat...Zhi Ze:This is my master, Zhi Xiu.Master Zhi Xiu:Amitabha... May I know
the purpose of your visit?
Li Xiaoyao:Well, to make it short～We've heard of your great
ability so would like you to 
help rid of those zombies.Master Zhi Xiu:I do not meddle with worldlyaffairs, please leave.
Li Xiaoyao:I don't get it, aren't monks
supposed to step in and help
if society is in trouble?
Master Zhi Xiu:Hmm... such convincing words.
You are indeed wise!
Li Xiaoyao:Don't flatter me～Master Zhi Xiu:Fine～If you do me a favor,I'll accept your requestto eliminate those zombies.Li Xiaoyao:As long as it's not immoral,
I'll definitely do it!
Master Zhi Xiu:Worry not～it's a good deed.
Li Xiaoyao:Then it'll be easy～!
Master Zhi Xiu:Hoho～wonderful! Zhi Ze, get
the scissors and clothes.
Zhi Ze:Yes..!
Li Xiaoyao:Master～could it be..?
Master Zhi Xiu:I'm shaving your head!
You've to become a monk.
Li, Zhao, Lin trio:What!? Not gonna happen!
Master Zhi Xiu:Amitabha～ Since you agreed,
I'll have to force you then!
Master Zhi Xiu:Zhi Zhang! Capture them!
Master Zhi Xiu:Oh! Why make such a big fuss?
All you need is a bald headto be a monk, no hardships.
Li Xiaoyao:What absurd favor is this?
I still want to get married!Master Zhi Xiu:How dumb of you! A monk upon
death goes to paradise.
What's so bad about it?
Li Xiaoyao:Appreciate your kind offer.
You can keep it for yourself,
I really love my hair style.So please excuse us～Bye!
Oh... we know the way out.
Master Zhi Xiu:Who says you can leave!
Li Xiaoyao:Evil monk... Go to hell!
Zhao Ling'er:Xiaoyao～Hold on!
Zhi Ze:*Sob* please forgive me...
I won't do it again...Lin Yueru:It's the queasy little monk!
Did you create those monks?Zhi Ze:I'm a 999-year Spirit Beads,
belonging to Bodhidharma.
Zhao Ling'er:If you've such a long
practice, then you should
seek consent, instead of
forcing people to be monks!
Zhi Ze:I... I just convert them to
be monks and didn't force
them to do anything bad.
In scripture: "Alleviate all
from suffering". I think
Buddha would recognize my
efforts, and so granting me
to be a deity in paradise.
Li Xiaoyao:Oh my god...What asceticism is that?
Little monk, who taught you?Zhi Ze:I... I read it in scriptures.
Zhao Ling'er:Help those in need withoutasking for rewards. This isthe main idea of Buddhism.If you still can't see theright path, then you arelikely to fail and all yourpractice will be useless.
Zhi Ze:Ah? You are a Bodhisattva!
Zhao Ling'er:Please stop, I'm not one.Zhi Ze:*Sob* I'm so happy. Nobodyever taught me these, pleasetake me as your apprentice.Zhao Ling'er:My mentor used to teach me
these principles...
Li Xiaoyao:Just take him with you.We trying to subdue the
zombies, he maybe be helpful.
Zhi Ze:Yes yes...! Please take me
with you! I know who's
controlling those zombies,
I can help to find them.

Ji San Niang:So long ago, who can recall?
Judge:So arrogant, answer or
I'll resort to punishment!
Ji San Niang:Oh～I remembered, that geezer
put there, and we thought he
doesn't need it. Out of
kindness, we even left some
fertilizers for his garden.Judge:Talking smart, eh?～ Fine!
You were also the one, who stole 5,000T from Mr. Li'spawnshop last year, no?Ji San Niang:The word STOLE doesn't fitin this context. A pawnshopoperates by lending money.What's the matter? I merelyborrowed some small change,as if he's starving now～
Judge:You can really sugarcoat!
Another question! Did you
steal 10,000T from BaronGu on this Jan?
Ji San Niang:He boasted his wealth can
feed tens of generations, so
I relief him a bit from his
ceaseless money counting.
Judge:Shut up! Shameless widow.
You're really helpless!
Ji San Niang:Aiyo～Such a small compulsion
and you label me helpless?
Getting cozy with someone's
wife must be hopeless right?Judge:You... *cough* bri... bringme my meds... *cough*Adviser:Judge! Get hold of yourself!No point to bicker with her.
Judge:*Sigh*～Deep breathing...
thought I was going to die!Ji San Niang:I say～you're hopeless, no?
Judge:Imprudent～! Punishment awaits
if you talk horse shit again.
Another one. You were theone who stole an antiquein the inn recently, right?
Ji San Niang:Antique?... I can't recall
anything about an antique.
Inn Owner:Sir, I've seen her dressedin the same manner stealingthe antique and these 2 were
the ones who chased her.
Antique Dealer:I didn't see who stole mythings, it was this couple
who returned most of them.Judge:Now everything seems clear.Anything else to say?!Ji San Niang:Oh, is that small gourd.Thought it was a valuable.Been in countless heists,never would I've foreseen to
be caught due to that trash.Guess this is just my fate～Judge:Since you've pleaded guilty,release these 2 innocents!
Take this thief to prison!Lin Yueru:   Xiaoyao!
Judge:Ok～You've proved your
innocence, you may leave!
Lin Yueru:   Thank you!
Li Xiaoyao:Are you alright in prison?
Lin Yueru:He～I used my dad's name as
a shield, so they dare not!
Officer:
This mansion's been seized.None shall enter.
Antique Dealer:Thank you for returningmy "PurpleGourd"!
Inn Owner:Mate, finally you are free!
Security Guard:You two may now leave town.
Security Guard:You're the one who caughtthe thieves' mastermind?
I'm really impressed!Obtained 5 S SwordThis well is sealed.Li Xiaoyao:Excuse me... Miss
Gai Luo Jiao:Oh, sorry do you know howto go to "YangZhou"?
Li Xiaoyao:We're facing the same issue.Gai Luo Jiao:I see, thanks anyway.Officer:Have you seen anyone whouses this kind weapon?Li Xiaoyao:Not that I know of...
Officer:The thieves use this weapon.Someone must be supplying it,
inquiry on weaponsmiths will
definitely yield some leads.
Store Owner:Sir, any weapons for you?Medicine Seller:Sir, you look awful. Can I
recommend you some medicine?
Resident:Why are you in my house?Resident:I told you to get out!Father:Su Lan, you're already 20,it's time to get married.
Daughter:I want to stay by your side!Kid:Are you the wanted bandit?
Kid:You don't look like him.
Resident:YangZhou is a messy place,
you better be armed.Resident:What's with the new judge?
Can't catch a few thieves?
Resident:YangZhou isn't a good
place for business becauseof those thieves. So unsafe.
Passerby:
Seriously, YangZhou isn't a
safe place to stay. Too manycrimes and so on, you betterthink twice in your travels.
Girl:Sir, feel free to browse.Pawnshop Owner:You want to sell something?Quick, let me take a look!Da Bao:Hey, stop running!Er Bao:Then stop following me!Security Guard:Where are you from?You look suspicious, answer!
Li Xiaoyao:I'm from YuHang county and
I'm looking for my friend.Officer:Don't think of any clever
ideas in YangZhou!
Officer:Not locals?! Be careful,
don't wander out at night.Passerby:
That lady thief is brazen.
She has stolen most of the
valuables, nothing for us.
Passerby:
Alas! No wonder YangZhou is
unsafe recently, those
officials are incompetent!
Fat hope on crimes be solved!
Lady Cook:Lad, you've come to the wrong
place, this is the kitchen.
Traveler:
I was ordered by master to go
to capital but now I'm stuck
in this city! What to do?
Traveler:
The band of thieves has been 
causing trouble recently.I don't have high hopes onthis new judge to resolve it.Traveler:
I think the new judge alsobought his current post.There's rumors that just2000T will do for his post;600T to be an adviser and200T for a security guard.Isn't it absurd?Traveler:
Once out of here, someday I
will buy myself a judge post.
Customer:YangZhou will perish
if this mess continues...Customer:I knew how chaotic here isso I hired a bodyguard
to protect my whole family.Customer:I'm the captain of Mighty Bodyguards, Xiao Honcho. Ifthere's any troublemakers,I'll kill them all on sight.
Resident:Everyone feels uneasy andwants to leave this town.Kid:I'm not to talk to outsiders.Beggar:Such shitty rules of fines,
it's so ridiculous!
*Sigh* So many crimes have
happened in our town and
then comes this new judge...
We're in real trouble.
Passerby:This new judge has been
fining many things since he
took office. All he wants is
to make a profit for himself.
Passerby:So many bans and fines. 
Is the judge trying to dealwith us or the thieves?Security Guard:Hey, stop loitering. You'renot supposed to be here.Officer:*Sigh* It's really hard work.I'm giving my best and folksare still complaining.Officer:I'm stressed and broke,
I was wrong to think I caneasily profit in this post.Security Guard:
I'm guarding the north gate.On Judge's order, no one is
allowed to leave this town.
Officer:What are you doing here?Get lost!Officer:You aren't allowed to stay.Security Guard:No loitering in prison.Officer:No loitering in prison.Visiting?Any prohibited items?Servant:Sir, my master is back now.Servant:Sir, you need something?Servant:Good day, Sir.
Attention～Judge:Anything else?Lin Yueru:Our rewards, we caught the
thieves. A bounty, no?
Judge:Oh, you're right! I was too
occupied with the lady thief.
So, the reward was 200T plusthe public-funded reward of1000T collected from ourresidents, so it's 1200T.be exactly 600,000G.Li Xiaoyao:Woah～ that's a lot!
Judge:I'm not done yet...
Based on local laws, therewill be a 20% reward tax and10% tax for town restoration.Secondly, throughout thisincident, 2 of my men diedand 7 were injured, so thetotal pension fee will be280,000G...Li Xiaoyao:All right, just tell ushow much do we get?Judge:140,000G remains... since 20people participated in thiscase, each will get 7000G.Oh, and 1500G was used forfor your reward plaque.So the remaining...yes～5500G will be yours.
Obtained 5500GLi Xiaoyao:Just... this petty amount?
Judge:You don't want the plaque?Li Xiaoyao:Save it for yourself!Judge:Hehe... see you again!Li Xiaoyao:Who'd ever thought of this!Lin Yueru:There must be a hidden room,
we better take a look.
Sheriff:
Come for a visit?You have to pay 300G first!Sheriff:
You can go inside now.Sheriff:
Good～You know the rules.
Li Xiaoyao:I have no money, what then?
Sheriff:
Oh, ya... right!The poor are free to pass.It's fine if you can't pay.Sheriff:
This way...Prisoner:Just because I've hit one ofthe sheriffs, I was fined
5000G and jailed for a year!That's totally not right!
Prisoner:What? Never seen a villain?Fat Man:*Sob* The new judge is crazy.Brothel is barred, and beingfat has harsher penalties.Prostitute:How unfortunate, I've onlyworked for 3 days.Prostitute:*Sigh* When will Mama-sanbail me out?Beggar:That new judge made a wholelot of crazy rules, evenbegging is now an offense.I was put to jail merelyfor receiving 2G.Beggar:Well, being prisoned seemsfine, getting fed and all.Just a little restricted.

Miss Song:
Ok...
Miss Song:
I'm really thankful you've
returned this bag. *Sigh*
It's all due to this "Gourd".
Lin Yueru:Is something wrong?Miss Song:
No, I mean my husband bought
from a grave robber. He was
told this is a legendary item.
Since then, demons have
befallen in our home. When
he heard there's a buyer in
YangZhou, he went there
in a hurry... but then...
Li Xiaoyao:Demons!? Probably...
this gourd is either
a legendary or cursed item.
Miss Song:
My husband told me...This "PurpleGourd" will be
handy for a spellcaster.
It's useless to me, so I'dwould like to give you the
gourd as my appreciation.

Black Miao Elder:Im～impossible...Gai Luo Jiao:Elder... no matter howstrong you are, you can'thandle this many people...You're so old, why still
work for that tyrant King?
Black Miao Elder:Don't you insult our King!
Gai Luo Jiao:Every Miao knows the King
was duped by Baiyue sect.
His body weakened while
learning their Dark Magic.
His wife and child were
persecuted by him and forced
into exile 10 years ago. Tsk～
Black Miao Elder:It's Black Miao's affairs.
Others shall not interfere!
Gai Luo Jiao:Based on White Miao'scustoms, we have the right
to care for our abandoned.
Queen was formerly our tribe's
Chief Priestess, we can duly
welcome her back to Da Li.
Black Miao Elder:Nonsense!You White Miao just want to
use Princess, the rightful
heir, to threaten our King.

Gai Luo Jiao:From YuHang?
That's pretty far away!Are you going for a visit?Li Xiaoyao:Actually... we are lookingfor somebody...Gai Luo Jiao:Haha～ Guess I'm wrong then!
Gai Luo Jiao:I'm Gai Luo Jiao, the girls
and I grew up in "Da Li".We came due to inter-tribe
conflicts in Miao region.
We're waiting for peace to
restore before returning to
our homeland.
Li Xiaoyao:I see... no wonder it's all
Miao girls and Miao food.
Gai Luo Jiao:Hehe～ Eat more
if you like them.
Miao Girl:   Big Sis! They're coming!
Gai Luo Jiao:Yes... it's about time too!
Gai Luo Jiao:Excuse me, I have some

Gai Luo Jiao:Sorry for the sleep powder,we meant no harm.
As you can see, we don'twish to get you involved
in this battle. Forgive me for my rudeness.Li Xiaoyao:Lady boss... just now...
besides all these dead, was
there another girl aboard?
Gai Luo Jiao:Princess was taken by awhite haired taoist.Li Xiaoyao:   Princess..?
Gai Luo Jiao:The Ling'er you're searching.
I've investigated and know
you'll will be passing here.
Li Xiaoyao:Then...Who was that taoist? Gai Luo Jiao:That taoist is known as theSword Master from Shu Sect.I was injured by Elder so...Lin Yueru:Sword Master is a righteous person, he stands for justice
vanquishing many demons.
If Ling'er was saved by him,
it'll be fine. Don't worry...
Li Xiaoyao:*Sigh* I hope so. But...
Gai Luo Jiao:Seems like I failed my
mission. I should go back Da
Li and ask for forgiveness.
Li Xiaoyao:*Sigh* Ling'er was so close
and now she's gone again.
Lin Yueru:Xiaoyao～we are close tothe Capital, is it ok we
visit my relative?
Li Xiaoyao:Sure, why not...Seller:Sweet candy... very cheap～
Seller:1 for 30G, but you're short.
Lin Yueru:Aunt Liu, how are you?
How have you been recently?
Madam Liu:
Good～ Dear... it's been a
while, you look prettier.
Seems marriage isn't an issue.
Lin Yueru:Aunt Liu... stop teasing me...
Madam Liu:
Is this Mr. Li?
Li Xiaoyao:Yes～Greetings, Madam Liu...
Madam Liu:
Call me Aunt Liu will do,
don't be so formal. I treatYueru like my real daughterand we're one big family.
Lin Yueru:Aunt Liu～ How could you say
that, we've yet to...
Madam Liu:
Not yet～ but soon right?
Jinyuan told me everything...
Ever since you were a child,
you always wanted to win.
Mr. Li must be really
talented to win your heart
in the Martial Arts contest.
Lin Yueru:Not true～ He... was lucky.
He'll not be my match if I
had fought seriously.
Li Xiaoyao:Huh? Seems like you
lost deliberately?Lin Yueru:Humph～ Of course!
If I'm not around, you'd have
long been eaten by demons.
Li Xiaoyao:Could you spare some grace?
This is so embarrassing.
Madam Liu:
Ok ok... no more bickering.
Madam Liu:
Yueru... still being so
direct and insistent.
Got to kick this habit away.
Lin Yueru:Aunt Liu..!
Madam Liu:
Haha～ However... it's what
makes our Yueru so adorable!
Sigh... It would have been
great if you'll to marry to
Jinyuan and be my
daughter-in-law...
Lin Yueru:Jinyuan is like my brother,
I've never thought of that.
Madam Liu:
I understand... Jinyuan
really isn't your type too.
Lin Yueru:Oh! Speaking of the devil,
where is Jinyuan?Madam Liu:
Jinyuan is down with an
illness since SuZhou. The docs
have not found the cause.
He's resting at the backyard
wing since last month.
Lin Yueru:Oh～ he's sick!?
May I visit him now?Madam Liu:
Of course, he'll be more
than happy to see you.
Madam Liu:
We have many exotic flowers
blooming in the backyard,
you should take a look.
Madam Liu:
I've told the chef to cook,do stay for dinner tonight.Madam Liu:
Have you seen Jinyuan?Did he take the medicine?Cai Yi:My husband is asleep, please

Liu Jinyuan:Much better now...I've taken it for so long but
the pain is getting worse.
Will I really be cured?
Cai Yi:Dear, please endure it.
I believe you'll recover
in a few more days...
Lin Yueru:Dear!?
Jinyuan, when did you marrysuch a beautiful girl?Liu Jinyuan:It... It's a long story.
Lin Yueru:What illness do you have?
We've met a few docs on the
way, maybe they can help you.
Liu Jinyuan:*Sigh* It's okay...I appreciate your concern.
My parents have invited many
docs but none of themcould even diagnose it...
Luckily, Cai Yi's hometown
has meds that made me better.
Li Xiaoyao:Sis, where are you from?
Cai Yi:My parents are from SuZhou.
Lin Yueru:Oh? You live in SuZhou too!
I've never seen you before.
Cai Yi:I...Li Xiaoyao:She's a stay-home lady, how
would you see her everyday!
Lin Yueru:Are you making fun of me!?Cai Yi:Apologies, my husband needs
to rest after his medicine.
Please come tomorrow to chat.

They were living togetherwith us when I was young.Let's go!Li Xiaoyao:Is my dressing okay?
Lin Yueru:Doesn't matter, you're
still a bun～haha!
Li Xiaoyao:Eh? Why does our spoiledgirl likes to eat such bun?Lin Yueru:Pff, save your nonsense.
Who likes to eat buns!?Servant:Ah, Mr. Li and Miss Lin,the dinner isn't ready yet.Servant:Once we're done preparing,I'll call you.Lady Chef:It's almost done!Ms. Lin, if you're hungry,I can make you some dessert.Lin Yueru:No, I'm fine. Thank you.Lady Chef:My recipes are favored by
Master and Madam. So I've
full responsibility here.
Servant:Hello, Mr. Li and Miss Lin.

Mr. Li, make yourself at home.Li Xiaoyao:Thank you for the meal.Lin Yueru:Hmm... what about Cai Yi!Isn't she eating with us?Madam Liu:
Since Jinyuan became sick,Cai Yi has been making foodfor him because Jinyuan can't
eat things that contain fatsand meats. Cai Yi said thatshe wants to eat togetherwith Jinyuan. Now they havebeen spending a lot oftime together and it's unlikelythat Cai Yi will come here.Lin Yueru:How did they get to knoweach other? I was surprisedthat Jinyuan is married!Madam Liu:
Cai Yi came a month ago.
She was traveling with her
family and they were killed bybandits and luckily sheescaped from the incident.Since then, she started to workin our mansion as a servant.My husband and I knewthat she has experience
with medicine so we entrust
Jinyuan to her.It's really odd, when Jinyuanwas sick, none of the docscould heal him.But since Cai Yi appearedJinyuan's condition has
improved day by day...Lin Yueru:They were then married???Madam Liu:
Yeah, I was thinkingmaybe it might be a signthat they're destined.Li Xiaoyao mumbles:
How dare he take advantage...
Lin Yueru:What did you SAY?Li Xiaoyao:I said that it must be fate!Lin Yueru:Eat your meal!And stop talking nonsense.Lin Yueru:Aunt Liu!I want to show him around.He has never been here.Madam Liu:
Hihi... I knew it!Go and have fun.

I already told themto burn this beads up!Li Xiaoyao:No... I'm asking where isthe owner of this beads?!Did you lock her up?Sword Master:Demons rightfully belong there.Li Xiaoyao:You! How dare you...Sword Master:Is there something wrong?Li Xiaoyao:She is my friend! She isjust a girl! How could you lock her up in that place?You want to kill her!?Sword Master:Friend? Mr. Li, you betterdon't befriend withthem next time.

It'spossibly a rumor to make you kill each other.Tian Gui Huang:Hmm... you're right...Zhao Ling'er:Everyone, there is an old saying: "Nothing is impossible toa willing mind". This tower haslocked so many demons andnobody has ever escaped from here... but due the factthat the tower was built by humans, there might be a wayto get out, I need all of youto think about it.Tian Gui Huang:Alright!

If the wise manhave an idea, why don't we listento him first?Book of Wise:Haha～If Miss Zhao is askingfor me, I would gladly help.So far I know...This tower was built around 500years ago in the Liang dynasty.King Liang ordered 1000workers and it took 20 years tofinish this tower. Initially heinvited taoists and monks tocreate barriers. As time goes,Shu took over the guarding roles.～Theoretically this tower hasentrance but no exit. The wallsare unbreakable without a divine weapon. Magic, MartialArts are out of question butthe structural properties...Zhao Ling'er:Destroying from inside?Book of Wise:Correct! Do you see these 11giant sword pillars? Based onmy observation, this placeis the core of the tower. Thesegiant sword pillars maintainthe Tower functions.Besides this one～seven ofthem respresent adragon also known asthis prison tower. The otherthree pillars symbolized theweapons which is used tonail the freedom of the dragon.Tian Gui Huang:That's simple,we just have destroy them!Book of Wise:I'm not done yet, dumbass!Why don't you use your brain?This tower is stabilized frombottom and not from above!Tian Gui Huang:You..!Book of Wise:Under this "Anti-Demon Water",there are definitely spotswhich are used to stabilize thistower. Once you destroyedthem, this tower will crumble.Tian Gui Huang:Are you kidding? This liquidis not friendly for demons,even a single drop makesyou want to die!Book of Wise:Right to the point! This tower ispurely made to imprison demons.This liquid is used to preventdemons dig a hole to theground or break the pillars.But they didn't take humansinto the consideration.Li Xiaoyao:Are you saying..?Book of Wise:This liquid is effective againstdemons but not humans.Lin Yueru:Alright! Xiaoyao, let's go!Book of Wise:This liquid is covered with oil on the surface. It's hardto dive with human weights.The only way is to finda spot that is less coveredwith oil. Try to look for a"whirlpool".Lin Yueru:Where is it?Book of Wise:The stream keeps changing,I can't tell you where thewhirlpool is. Try on your own.Phew... alright I'm doneI'll leave the rest to you.I'm taking a break now!Li Xiaoyao:Now, it's settled!Li Xiaoyao:Gui Huang, I'll break thepillars and you should go and inform everyone that we'regoing to get out of here!Tian Gui Huang:Understood!Tian Gui Huang:Everyone listen, go and getyour family and friends andonce you finished packing,come back to this place!Tian Gui Huang:Good luck～!Li Xiaoyao:Alright, shall we go? Zhao Ling'er:I'm going too...Lin Yueru:But... you...Zhao Ling'er:I...

Ah Nu:

You mistook me as your wife?Li Xiaoyao:Yeah... sorry again.(
Ah Nu:
Hmm... you need the egg shell?Li Xiaoyao:Yes, can I have it?Ah Nu:
Okay～I'll keep this eggtil its hatch, then youcan have the egg shell.Li Xiaoyao:You're making it to hatch?(
Ah Nu:
Don't worry, I know how.I'm not giving you for free though, you gotta help too.Li Xiaoyao:Alright, fair enough!Ah Nu:
Hihi～Then follow me!)
Li Xiaoyao:Where're we going?Ah Nu:
There's a "Wooden Cave" inthe forest, and I want youto find something with me.Li Xiaoyao:Is this the place you mentioned?The thing you want is here?Ah Nu:
Yeah, I tried to steal it,but their boss is strong. Isaw him left the cave.Now there are only weak demons inside. It will be apiece of cake with you! Li Xiaoyao:So in other words～I've to play a sweeper right?Ah Nu:
Hihi～They must be easy foryou since you were able todefeat our divine phoenix.Li Xiaoyao:Gosh～I can't believe it..."....!!"Ah Nu:
Damn... it's empty!He put it here yesterday.Li Xiaoyao:What are you looking for?Ah Nu:
Well I'm looking for...Water Jewel!Li Xiaoyao:Jewel? I have Thunder,and Wind you want them?Ah Nu:
Are you playing dumb?Or are you serious?Li Xiaoyao:All I know is these jewels will make demons more powerful...Ah Nu:
Huh?! Where did you got that from? Based on the history,North Barbarians had a warwith Miao people. Theywere defeated at first. Those barbarians asked Lord ofUniverse to send 5 Gods to support them. Later on theyare denied from going backand started bringing naturaldisasters into this world.People lost their home anddied of hunger. One day ,ahalf-human, half-serpent witch appeared. She wasable to seal those 5 godsin 5 different jewels and return peace to our world.She is adored by the name"Nuwa" in our tribe. She handed the 5 jewels to usand it's meant to balancethis world and protect ourrace. However these jewelswent missing in theprevious generation.Li Xiaoyao:Woah! Incredible...Ah Nu:
It took me a lot of time tofind out the jewel was here...Li Xiaoyao:If your story was true, thenthese jewels must be dangerous!Ah Nu:
I'm not looking it for fun!Miao region has been plaguedby a prolonged drought andwe're almost running out offood. White and Black arefighting for water resources.Li Xiaoyao:This war doesn't make sense...Ah Nu:
That's why I need the WaterJewel. There was a prolongeddrought before. Queen, then
a priestess, used the jewel
to resolve the drought.
I believe the jewel is the
key our current crisis.
Li Xiaoyao:Ha～You're really tougherthan you look. Maybe the jewelwas taken away. We betterleave this cave first and have a look on the outside.Ah Nu:
Wait! Let's take thesetreasures first.Ah Nu:
We came all the way to thisplace so we aren't going outwithout anything, hihi!)

Whyare you hating him so much?Resident:We can't. This is a secret of ourvillage, we can't tell strangers.Resident C:It's useless to talk about itright now. Ah Tao's dad was

Whenhe was leaving, we let himdrank the "Oblivion Water",but was swapped out by Ah Tao.

him so easily.Ah Tao:

evil demon, but I seriously
don't think so.Miao Resident:
Miao people really treasuretheir forest. Every singlefamily needs to cultivate 100trees if they have male child.When they grow up and tie theknot, they can cut off some ofthe trees to build a new house,otherwise it's forbidden.Those foreigners cut offeverything without even askingfor permission.Kid:My dad is a strong Miao soldier,he'll expel those foreigners!Kid:So much flooding...I hope everyone is alright.Miao Girl:We have to thank Cleric whowarned us from this disasterMiao Girl:Our tribe believes "Cult Moon"as a religion.

It took too manyyears to form this countryand it's going down because of that evilwoman. We have to dosomething to avoid it.But!! Our King doesn'twant to punish her because of her beauty...I, Baiyue, as your"Cult Moon Cleric" willtake responsiblity inprotecting our folks!!!Soldiers:Long live Baiyue!!
Cleric Baiyue:Everyone!! I need yoursupport!! Today, I'll makeour King make his finaldecision to behead theQueen and her supporters.Soldiers:Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!Black Miao Elder:Baiyue! You crossed theline! Our King might bewrong but he is still ourKing, you can't do that!Cleric Baiyue:This is the only wayto save this country!Black Miao Elder:But...Cleric Baiyue:Elder, don't worry. I'lltake the full responsibility!Guard:This is prison!Why did you come here?Li Xiaoyao:The King wants me todeliver a word to the Queen.Guard:I see... go in!Li Xiaoyao:Are you the Queen?

All I wish is the safety ofmy daughter...Li Xiaoyao:I met a lady with your daughter,they were followed bya bunch of Miao soldiers.Queen:

That place is guarded by Elder.If you meet him, just tell himQing'er told you to get a Lotus.
Li Xiaoyao:Qing'er... Lotus..?
Queen:

You may ask for rewards.Li Xiaoyao:No, I want to ask youif you still lovethe King or not...Queen:

*Sigh* Thank you but it'sunlikely to happen...HOLD!Queen:
King...King:Qing'er, you're betraying me?
Queen:
It's a misunderstanding...King:I was told you're a demon,not a human. Is that true?Queen:

many and now kidnapping. Heh～
meeting me is your reckoning!
... Princess! Please go with
us back to Miao. On King's
orders, we're to bring you
back at all costs.
NO! You killed grandma,
you're going to pay!
Ridiculous! She secretly
took you out of palace,
separating you from the King,
She's a traitor! She even
made you learn all these
dark Chinese magic.
For these 10 years...
Liar! I... I've no father,
grandma said he died long ago.
Your father is the King,
"Nan Zao of Black Miao".You won't know as you're only6 years old when taken away.Lies～ You are lying! I
don't want to hear, be gone.
Hey! She said BE GONE!Shut up, brat! If you obstruct
again, I'll kill you too!
NO! I'll never believe you.I'll find my mother with him.See～ she already said no.
Just leave now, orI'll show no mercy.Then I'll take you by force!Get out of the way!!
How can you be so cruel?Servants are humans too!
I do whatever I like,
it's none of your business!
