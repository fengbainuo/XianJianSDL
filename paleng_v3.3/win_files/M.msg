Zombies are immune to most
attacks and their poisons
are deadly. They used to
roam on moonless nights, but
are now rampant even in the
day. If this continues, our
village will be in danger.
Li Xiaoyao:Doctor Han, don't give up.All things have a weakness,
demons are not excluded.
There must be a zombie cure.
Han Meng Ci:I know of a qualified person!
Li Xiaoyao:Really! Miss Han, you know?
Han Meng Ci:A month ago, a monk called
"Zhi Xiu" repelled a zombie
group and saved 3 brothers.
They then became Zhi Xiu's
apprentices and his temple
was never harmed again.Li Xiaoyao:Great! Let's ask thosemonks to rid the zombies.
Han Meng Ci:But... you...
It won't work cause...
Doctor Han:Meng Ci¡« let me explain...
Doctor Han:I already sent men to askZhi Xiu for the favor,but... none of them has
ever returned.
Li Xiaoyao:You serious? Could it bethe monks are cannibals!?
Doctor Han:No... they all became monks.
Li Xiaoyao:Maybe... Master Zhi Xiuis really enlightening.
Doctor Han:Not so... please hear me out.
Doctor Han:Meng Ci was in cordial terms
with the eldest monk and has
a marriage arrangement when
Meng Ci turns 16. The three
brothers volunteered on my
wish to seek Master Zhi Xiu's
help, but didn't return.
Only upon our many visits
did we discovered they have
become monks. Even now,
we're puzzled about it.
Li Xiaoyao:Seems like... this village
has many troubles...
Doctor Han:Make haste to give the med.Han Meng Ci:Thank you all...Doctor Han:Ha¡«Don't mention it,
it's a doctor's duty.
Han Meng Ci:If you need any ingredients,
go ask my brother, Ah Bao.
Hunter:Hey, I've set an animal
trap up ahead. Please be
careful not to step on it.
I'll surely trap the antler.Doctor Han:Ms. Zhao... sorry for being
blunt, they're concerned
but why do you avoid them?
Zhao Ling'er:I... don't want to let them
know about this matter.
Doctor Han:I see... Don't worry,I'll keep it as a secret.
Doctor Han:*Sigh* but... as an unwed...and with your health,
how do you live if there's
no one to care for you?
Zhao Ling'er:Doctor...Doctor Han:You can stay here for awhile and think about it.Doctor Han:There's no doubt I can tellMr. Li¡«isn't a fickle man.
Girl:Thank you for saving us...Li Xiaoyao:No need to thank us,we're just helping out.
Girl:I live in "White Water
Village". If you don't mind,
come over and visit us.Li Xiaoyao:*Sigh*, it wasn't intended¡«
Lin Yueru:Don't worry¡«Ling'er will be fine...Li Xiaoyao:Guess... back to square one.
Miao Man:
Nothing's here! Go away!Miao Man:
You deaf!? Want a beating?
Doctor Han:Oh no¡«Meng Ci is kidnapped!
Li Xiaoyao:Who did it?
Doctor Han:A Baiyue Elder said Ms.
Zhao has to go "Mt. Gui Yin"in exchange for my daughter.Li Xiaoyao:Damn it...It's those Miaos again!
Zhao Ling'er:Doctor Han, their target isme, she'll be alright.Zhao Ling'er:Xiaoyao¡«I'm in her debt,
we need to save her.
Li Xiaoyao:Certainly! This time I'llbeat till they never thinkof laying a finger on you!Doctor Han:Please, save Han Ci!
Miao Man:
Halt! Who are you?Zhao Ling'er:I'm Zhao Ling'er.Release Sis Meng Ci.
Miao Man:

Intruders shall be punished!Lin Yueru:See! I'm faster in getting
the three other ingredients.
How did I get them? Hee...
My dad has a whole lot, so
I slipped home to take them.
Found the other ingredients?Bridge Guard:

A Fishing ToolOld Man:I'm grateful for your help.I would like to propose mydaughter to you.Li Xiaoyao:Ah! Please stop joking.

Girl:Oh, it's you who saved me.May I ask for your name?Li Xiaoyao:I'm Xiaoyao, Li Xiaoyao.
It's just a small matter,
don't take it to heart.

Villager:Man, curse these sellers

crisis mode and are afraid
of zombies coming over here.How could you raise the riceprices if you know it's theonly way to save them?Rice Seller:Damn you brat! How dare you
to pry my business? Begone!
Li Xiaoyao:It's not about who's prying,
no one's gonna tolerate this.
Rice Seller:They're not savvy enough
when Black Water Village
was attacked, with no one
taking it seriously. I've
seized the chance and bought
all the rice to turn around
with ten times profit¡«Haha!
Rice Seller:Got to be smart in business,

Li Xiaoyao:Ha¡« how could even a monk
remain calmed after seeing
you 2 beauties?
Lin Yueru:   Pff¡«be serious!
Zhao Ling'er:.......Li Xiaoyao:   Ling'er... what's wrong?
Zhao Ling'er:I kept sensing in this temple
that... there's a spirit.
Li Xiaoyao:Really? How could it be!
This is a divine temple.
Zhao Ling'er:I'm unable to say... but
it's not really sinister.
Zhi Ze:I'm really sorry... we can'tattend to any visitors now.Li Xiaoyao:Oh, is Master Zhi Xiu away?Zhi Ze:Well, it's messy inside, wehave to clean up so...

Zhi Zhang:I've had enough! I'm gonna
chop down this bastard.
Li Xiaoyao:May I know what's going on?Zhi Zhang:This bastard deceived me!
I was working as a butcher before, and have to eat at
least 3kg of meat daily.
He said that if I become a
monk, then I can eat much
more without working. It was
all lies upon coming here!
Zhi Ze:There's food and drinks, no?Zhi Zhang:EAT RICE, DRINK TEA right!?
Li Xiaoyao:Think you've mistaken...A monk has to be vegetarian.Zhi Zhang:Can I quit being a monk?
I finally caught a wild deerand I was about to eat itand who the hell everthought he pour it all away.
Li Xiaoyao:A wild deer...?Zhi Zhang:Yes¡«a deer with a broken
horn and injured leg. Seeing
it's rotten to the bone, I
relieved its suffering early!
Li Xiaoyao:You...(
Lin Yueru:Just go if you want to quit.Such behavior is unsightly.
Zhi Zhang:I wish I could go!
Lin Yueru:What do you mean?Zhi Zhang:The day when Master Zhi Xiushaved my hair, I lost allmy memory except for being abutcher and my meat cravings!
Lin Yueru:Funny to have such weird man!
Zhi Ze:Everyone, here is my master,Master Zhi Xiu.Zhi Zhang:I want to eat meat...Zhi Ze:This is my master, Zhi Xiu.Master Zhi Xiu:Amitabha... May I know
the purpose of your visit?
Li Xiaoyao:Well, to make it short¡«We've heard of your great
ability so would like you to 
help rid of those zombies.Master Zhi Xiu:I do not meddle with worldlyaffairs, please leave.
Li Xiaoyao:I don't get it, aren't monks
supposed to step in and help
if society is in trouble?
Master Zhi Xiu:Hmm... such convincing words.
You are indeed wise!
Li Xiaoyao:Don't flatter me¡«Master Zhi Xiu:Fine¡«If you do me a favor,I'll accept your requestto eliminate those zombies.Li Xiaoyao:As long as it's not immoral,
I'll definitely do it!
Master Zhi Xiu:Worry not¡«it's a good deed.

Master Zhi Xiu:Oh! Why make such a big fuss?
All you need is a bald headto be a monk, no hardships.
Li Xiaoyao:What absurd favor is this?
I still want to get married!Master Zhi Xiu:How dumb of you! A monk upon
death goes to paradise.
What's so bad about it?
Li Xiaoyao:Appreciate your kind offer.
You can keep it for yourself,
I really love my hair style.So please excuse us¡«Bye!
Oh... we know the way out.

Li Xiaoyao:Evil monk... Go to hell!
Zhao Ling'er:Xiaoyao¡«Hold on!
Zhi Ze:*Sob* please forgive me...
I won't do it again...Lin Yueru:It's the queasy little monk!
Did you create those monks?Zhi Ze:I'm a 999-year Spirit Beads,
belonging to Bodhidharma.
Zhao Ling'er:If you've such a long
practice, then you should
seek consent, instead of
forcing people to be monks!
Zhi Ze:I... I just convert them to
be monks and didn't force
them to do anything bad.
In scripture: "Alleviate all
from suffering". I think
Buddha would recognize my
efforts, and so granting me
to be a deity in paradise.
Li Xiaoyao:Oh my god...What asceticism is that?
Little monk, who taught you?Zhi Ze:I... I read it in scriptures.
Zhao Ling'er:Help those in need withoutasking for rewards. This isthe main idea of Buddhism.If you still can't see theright path, then you arelikely to fail and all yourpractice will be useless.
Zhi Ze:Ah? You are a Bodhisattva!
Zhao Ling'er:Please stop, I'm not one.Zhi Ze:*Sob* I'm so happy. Nobodyever taught me these, pleasetake me as your apprentice.Zhao Ling'er:My mentor used to teach me
these principles...

controlling those zombies,

Li Xiaoyao:What!...Judge:She'll be dealt if you flee!
Officer:
We're tipped off the thief is
stashing here. Indeed it is!
You are all under arrest!No money, no talk!Sheriff:
Paying a visit? 100G then.Sheriff:
This way!
Sheriff:
Anything else?Li Xiaoyao:Yueru... are you alright?Lin Yueru:Pff... it's all your fault!Li Xiaoyao:Don't be like this... I
I promise¡« I'll catch the
real lady thief to save you.
Lin Yueru:You better do so,
or I'll ignore you forever.
"A secret door behind the screen."
Ji San Niang:Oh¡«your return was fast, no?
Li Xiaoyao:You're not going anywhere!Lady Thief:Sweetie¡«It's hard to killsomeone so handsome...
Judge:Woah, didn't expect you tocatch her that quickly?
Li Xiaoyao:I've told you we're innocent!Judge:Miss, look at me I needto ask you a few questions.
Ji San Niang:......Judge:Imprudent, I'm asking you.
Why aren't you answering?
Ji San Niang:Were you talking to me?I thought you were singing.Judge:How¡« dare you!
Ignoring my presence. Youmust be bored of life!
Ji San Niang:Hahahaha!Judge:Shut up! What's so funny!
Ji San Niang:I regret that I didn't killyou that night, when youwere having an affair in thegarden with Wang's 3rd wife,
turning into this mess.
Judge:   You...
Li Xiaoyao:HAHAHA!Judge:Shut up!! Stop laughing¡«
Adviser:Judge, she's just a thief.Don't take it seriously.Judge:I'm... really pissed!
Judge:Did you steal a gold-filled
jar from Xu Mansion's
garden last Oct and replaced
it with dung instead?
Ji San Niang:So long ago, who can recall?
Judge:So arrogant, answer or
I'll resort to punishment!
Ji San Niang:Oh¡«I remembered, that geezer
put there, and we thought he
doesn't need it. Out of
kindness, we even left some
fertilizers for his garden.Judge:Talking smart, eh?¡« Fine!
You were also the one, who stole 5,000T from Mr. Li'spawnshop last year, no?Ji San Niang:The word STOLE doesn't fitin this context. A pawnshopoperates by lending money.What's the matter? I merelyborrowed some small change,as if he's starving now¡«
Judge:You can really sugarcoat!
Another question! Did you
steal 10,000T from BaronGu on this Jan?
Ji San Niang:He boasted his wealth can
feed tens of generations, so
I relief him a bit from his
ceaseless money counting.
Judge:Shut up! Shameless widow.
You're really helpless!
Ji San Niang:Aiyo¡«Such a small compulsion
and you label me helpless?
Getting cozy with someone's
wife must be hopeless right?Judge:You... *cough* bri... bringme my meds... *cough*Adviser:Judge! Get hold of yourself!No point to bicker with her.
Judge:*Sigh*¡«Deep breathing...
thought I was going to die!Ji San Niang:I say¡«you're hopeless, no?
Judge:Imprudent¡«! Punishment awaits
if you talk horse shit again.
Another one. You were theone who stole an antiquein the inn recently, right?
Ji San Niang:Antique?... I can't recall
anything about an antique.
Inn Owner:Sir, I've seen her dressedin the same manner stealingthe antique and these 2 were
the ones who chased her.
Antique Dealer:I didn't see who stole mythings, it was this couple
who returned most of them.Judge:Now everything seems clear.Anything else to say?!Ji San Niang:Oh, is that small gourd.Thought it was a valuable.Been in countless heists,never would I've foreseen to
be caught due to that trash.Guess this is just my fate¡«Judge:Since you've pleaded guilty,release these 2 innocents!
Take this thief to prison!Lin Yueru:   Xiaoyao!
Judge:Ok¡«You've proved your
innocence, you may leave!
Lin Yueru:   Thank you!
Li Xiaoyao:Are you alright in prison?
Lin Yueru:He¡«I used my dad's name as
a shield, so they dare not!
Officer:
This mansion's been seized.None shall enter.
Antique Dealer:Thank you for returningmy "PurpleGourd"!
Inn Owner:Mate, finally you are free!
Security Guard:You two may now leave town.
Security Guard:You're the one who caughtthe thieves' mastermind?
I'm really impressed!Obtained 5 S SwordThis well is sealed.Li Xiaoyao:Excuse me... Miss
Gai Luo Jiao:Oh, sorry do you know howto go to "YangZhou"?
Li Xiaoyao:We're facing the same issue.Gai Luo Jiao:I see, thanks anyway.Officer:Have you seen anyone whouses this kind weapon?Li Xiaoyao:Not that I know of...
Officer:The thieves use this weapon.Someone must be supplying it,
inquiry on weaponsmiths will
definitely yield some leads.
Store Owner:Sir, any weapons for you?Medicine Seller:Sir, you look awful. Can I
recommend you some medicine?
Resident:Why are you in my house?Resident:I told you to get out!Father:Su Lan, you're already 20,it's time to get married.
Daughter:I want to stay by your side!Kid:Are you the wanted bandit?
Kid:You don't look like him.
Resident:YangZhou is a messy place,
you better be armed.Resident:What's with the new judge?
Can't catch a few thieves?
Resident:YangZhou isn't a good
place for business becauseof those thieves. So unsafe.
Passerby:
Seriously, YangZhou isn't a
safe place to stay. Too manycrimes and so on, you betterthink twice in your travels.
Girl:Sir, feel free to browse.Pawnshop Owner:You want to sell something?Quick, let me take a look!Da Bao:Hey, stop running!Er Bao:Then stop following me!Security Guard:Where are you from?You look suspicious, answer!
Li Xiaoyao:I'm from YuHang county and
I'm looking for my friend.Officer:Don't think of any clever
ideas in YangZhou!
Officer:Not locals?! Be careful,
don't wander out at night.Passerby:
That lady thief is brazen.
She has stolen most of the
valuables, nothing for us.
Passerby:
Alas! No wonder YangZhou is
unsafe recently, those
officials are incompetent!
Fat hope on crimes be solved!
Lady Cook:Lad, you've come to the wrong
place, this is the kitchen.
Traveler:
I was ordered by master to go
to capital but now I'm stuck
in this city! What to do?
Traveler:
The band of thieves has been 
causing trouble recently.I don't have high hopes onthis new judge to resolve it.Traveler:
I think the new judge alsobought his current post.There's rumors that just2000T will do for his post;600T to be an adviser and200T for a security guard.Isn't it absurd?Traveler:
Once out of here, someday I
will buy myself a judge post.
Customer:YangZhou will perish
if this mess continues...Customer:I knew how chaotic here isso I hired a bodyguard
to protect my whole family.Customer:I'm the captain of Mighty Bodyguards, Xiao Honcho. Ifthere's any troublemakers,I'll kill them all on sight.
Resident:Everyone feels uneasy andwants to leave this town.Kid:I'm not to talk to outsiders.Beggar:Such shitty rules of fines,
it's so ridiculous!
*Sigh* So many crimes have
happened in our town and
then comes this new judge...
We're in real trouble.
Passerby:This new judge has been
fining many things since he
took office. All he wants is
to make a profit for himself.
Passerby:So many bans and fines. 
Is the judge trying to dealwith us or the thieves?Security Guard:Hey, stop loitering. You'renot supposed to be here.Officer:*Sigh* It's really hard work.I'm giving my best and folksare still complaining.Officer:I'm stressed and broke,
I was wrong to think I caneasily profit in this post.Security Guard:
I'm guarding the north gate.On Judge's order, no one is
allowed to leave this town.
Officer:What are you doing here?Get lost!Officer:You aren't allowed to stay.Security Guard:No loitering in prison.Officer:No loitering in prison.Visiting?Any prohibited items?Servant:Sir, my master is back now.Servant:Sir, you need something?Servant:Good day, Sir.
Attention¡«Judge:Anything else?Lin Yueru:Our rewards, we caught the
thieves. A bounty, no?
Judge:Oh, you're right! I was too
occupied with the lady thief.
So, the reward was 200T plusthe public-funded reward of1000T collected from ourresidents, so it's 1200T.be exactly 600,000G.Li Xiaoyao:Woah¡« that's a lot!
Judge:I'm not done yet...
Based on local laws, therewill be a 20% reward tax and10% tax for town restoration.Secondly, throughout thisincident, 2 of my men diedand 7 were injured, so thetotal pension fee will be280,000G...Li Xiaoyao:All right, just tell ushow much do we get?Judge:140,000G remains... since 20people participated in thiscase, each will get 7000G.Oh, and 1500G was used forfor your reward plaque.So the remaining...yes¡«5500G will be yours.

Sheriff:

I've never thought of that.
Madam Liu:
I understand... Jinyuan

Mr. Li, make yourself at home.Li Xiaoyao:Thank you for the meal.Lin Yueru:Hmm... what about Cai Yi!Isn't she eating with us?Madam Liu:
Since Jinyuan became sick,Cai Yi has been making foodfor him because Jinyuan can't
eat things that contain fatsand meats. Cai Yi said thatshe wants to eat togetherwith Jinyuan. Now they havebeen spending a lot oftime together and it's unlikelythat Cai Yi will come here.Lin Yueru:How did they get to knoweach other? I was surprisedthat Jinyuan is married!Madam Liu:
Cai Yi came a month ago.
She was traveling with her
family and they were killed bybandits and luckily sheescaped from the incident.Since then, she started to workin our mansion as a servant.My husband and I knewthat she has experience
with medicine so we entrust
Jinyuan to her.It's really odd, when Jinyuanwas sick, none of the docscould heal him.But since Cai Yi appearedJinyuan's condition has
improved day by day...Lin Yueru:They were then married???Madam Liu:
Yeah, I was thinkingmaybe it might be a signthat they're destined.Li Xiaoyao mumbles:
How dare he take advantage...
Lin Yueru:What did you SAY?Li Xiaoyao:I said that it must be fate!Lin Yueru:Eat your meal!And stop talking nonsense.Lin Yueru:Aunt Liu!I want to show him around.He has never been here.Madam Liu:

Cai Yi comes here sometimes.Li Xiaoyao:This scent smells so good!Did you cultivated them all?Cai Yi:Do you like these flowers?Li Xiaoyao:Who won't like beautiful things?Lin Yueru:So many butterflies...It must be these flowers.Cai Yi:Their lifespan are shortbut flying around theseflowers might be the bestthings ever happen to them...Cai Yi:Do you like these flowers?Li Xiaoyao:Could it be... that he became sick because you don't wantto marry him?Lin Yueru:That's your stupid opinion!Li Xiaoyao:Well I just feel likeI owe him something...Lin Yueru:Even though we both grew uptogether, it doesn't meanthat I have to love him.He is just like my brother.Li Xiaoyao:He didn't think that way!

your dad to entrust you to him!Lin Yueru:Who cares what my dad is going to say! He is like mybrother! Believe it or not!Lin Yueru:Dad!! Wha...What are you doing here?Lin Tiannan:I'm looking for you¡«can't I?Lin Yueru:I'm not going back!Madam Liu:

It's because I'veseen you and Miss Zhao arehaving some sort of an affair.This is unacceptable.Li Xiaoyao:I'm sorry, but I have touphold my promise.

Okay¡«I'll keep this eggtil its hatch, then youcan have the egg shell.Li Xiaoyao:You're making it to hatch?(

Don't worry, I know how.I'm not giving you for free though, you gotta help too.Li Xiaoyao:Alright, fair enough!Ah Nu:
Hihi¡«Then follow me!)
Li Xiaoyao:Where're we going?Ah Nu:
There's a "Wooden Cave" inthe forest, and I want youto find something with me.Li Xiaoyao:Is this the place you mentioned?The thing you want is here?Ah Nu:
Yeah, I tried to steal it,but their boss is strong. Isaw him left the cave.Now there are only weak demons inside. It will be apiece of cake with you! Li Xiaoyao:So in other words¡«I've to play a sweeper right?Ah Nu:
Hihi¡«They must be easy foryou since you were able todefeat our divine phoenix.Li Xiaoyao:Gosh¡«I can't believe it..."....!!"Ah Nu:
Damn... it's empty!He put it here yesterday.Li Xiaoyao:What are you looking for?Ah Nu:
Well I'm looking for...Water Jewel!Li Xiaoyao:Jewel? I have Thunder,and Wind you want them?Ah Nu:
Are you playing dumb?Or are you serious?Li Xiaoyao:All I know is these jewels will make demons more powerful...Ah Nu:
Huh?! Where did you got that from? Based on the history,North Barbarians had a warwith Miao people. Theywere defeated at first. Those barbarians asked Lord ofUniverse to send 5 Gods to support them. Later on theyare denied from going backand started bringing naturaldisasters into this world.People lost their home anddied of hunger. One day ,ahalf-human, half-serpent witch appeared. She wasable to seal those 5 godsin 5 different jewels and return peace to our world.She is adored by the name"Nuwa" in our tribe. She handed the 5 jewels to usand it's meant to balancethis world and protect ourrace. However these jewelswent missing in theprevious generation.Li Xiaoyao:Woah! Incredible...Ah Nu:
It took me a lot of time tofind out the jewel was here...Li Xiaoyao:If your story was true, thenthese jewels must be dangerous!Ah Nu:
I'm not looking it for fun!Miao region has been plaguedby a prolonged drought andwe're almost running out offood. White and Black arefighting for water resources.Li Xiaoyao:This war doesn't make sense...Ah Nu:
That's why I need the WaterJewel. There was a prolongeddrought before. Queen, then
a priestess, used the jewel
to resolve the drought.
I believe the jewel is the
key our current crisis.
Li Xiaoyao:Ha¡«You're really tougherthan you look. Maybe the jewelwas taken away. We betterleave this cave first and have a look on the outside.Ah Nu:
Wait! Let's take thesetreasures first.Ah Nu:
We came all the way to thisplace so we aren't going outwithout anything, hihi!)

this village are bad. Don'tlet them trick you again!Resident:Our village is isolated fromthe outside, but sincethat guy called "Song" camehere, everything changed.Lady B:Right! We were nice to him,but he turned around andbit us.Li Xiaoyao:Don't worry, we do notcome with evil intentions.Lady B:I'm talking about that Song,not you!Li Xiaoyao:Can you tell me what hedid to this village? Whyare you hating him so much?Resident:We can't. This is a secret of ourvillage, we can't tell strangers.Resident C:It's useless to talk about itright now. Ah Tao's dad was
caught by them. And hemight already told those badpeople where our treasuresare hidden...Resident:*Sigh*About a month ago, someonefound this village.It was a surprise for us tosee people from outside so we treated him nicely. Whenhe was leaving, we let himdrank the "Oblivion Water",but was swapped out by Ah Tao.
Resident C:Now he came back with abunch of monsters totake our treasures.Could it be that youare their friends too?Trying to take advantage? Li Xiaoyao:No no, I really hate suchpeople. Just tell me where he is and I'll save Ah Tao'sfather.Ah Tao:Really?! That's great!!Resident:Ah Tao! Don't trust
him so easily.Ah Tao:

She's a traitor! She even
made you learn all these
